### Account creation

Design a typical **account creation form** for a fictional website. If all details are valid, `submit` should take the user to a new page showing them the details of their newly created account.

Fields to collect from your user:

| Field            | Restrictions                                                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First Name       | Required                                                                    |
| Last Name        | Required                                                                    |
| Username         | Must be a mix of letters and numbers, no other characters or spaces allowed |
| Avatar Image url | Valid Url                                                                   |

#### Submit Page

Once the user has signed up to your website they should be taken to a profile page where they can view all of the information they've just submitted. Think about the layout of profile pages you may have used in the past and create a user friendly site displaying their information.

_Additional_

- Allow your users to choose between _light_ and _dark_ mode for their profile. Style their profile page according to their preference.
